This implementation of a simple Game Engine is developed using HTML and Javascript using the p5.js 
library as an additional tool supporting timing, graphics rendering, and keyboard input.

The ADT provided in class was used as a base for this implementation, though the Scene class was largely 
broken down into global variables and p5 functions.

The sample game programmed into this implementation involves moving a basic player sprite using WASD
to collect static sprites around the scene. 

Current state of this implementation includes issues with bounding and collision. The bounding issue for
WRAP and BOUNCE bounding actions results in the player sprite being removed from the game, and the STOP 
action locking the player to the boundary wall. The collision issue is registering collisions with all
sprites simultaneously, even without the player sprite coming into contact with the static sprites. The
cause of this issue has not yet been identified, though likely has a source in improper use of the 
collision principles present in Prof. Harris' simple game code.

In addition to these issues, further work would be needed to enable the engine to operate as a template
for other programs, as the current functionality is largely keyed to the specific example this 
implementation is presenting.
